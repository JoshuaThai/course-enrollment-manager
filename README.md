# Course Enrollment Manager <br/>(Final project for Introduction to Software Engineering course)
## Project Description:
Each semester, students enroll in courses based on availability, prerequisites, and scheduling 
preferences. The university's current enrollment process involves multiple platforms, including 
spreadsheets, email communications, and manual approvals, leading to scheduling conflicts and 
inefficiencies. Some courses have limited seats, while others require instructor approval, making 
the process even more complex. Currently, students register through an outdated system, often 
resulting in errors, duplicate enrollments, and difficulties in tracking waitlists. Additionally, faculty 
members manually approve enrollment requests via email, creating unnecessary delays. Advisors 
struggle to guide students effectively due to the lack of real-time enrollment data. To address these 
issues, the university wants to replace the current system with a centralized web application 
written in Python using Django framework. This application will manage course enrollments 
efficiently while ensuring students, faculty, and advisors have the necessary tools to make 
informed decisions. Each team in CS361 is required to develop the application according to the 
given instructions.

## What did we do?:
I worked in a team of 4 to create a web application using Django, HTML, and CSS that enabled for professors, students, and administrators to manage course enrollments and other various tasks
such enrollment requests and available course based on their respective view. We followed the SCRUM methodology to ensure collaboration and timely completion of work. I was tasked with completing Administrator view and assisted in the Student and Professor view. We worked on this project for 4 weeks and presented during the final exam week of the Spring 2025 semester. I help lead the live technical demonstration of our project during presentations.
